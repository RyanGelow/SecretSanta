## **How It Works:**

1. **Seeded Random Generation** - Uses the year (2025) as a seed, so assignments are always the same for that year
2. **Individual Login** - Each person selects their name and enters their unique code
3. **Admin Panel** - Enter admin password to see all assignments
4. **Consistent Results** - Same assignments every time someone logs in during the year

## **Setup Instructions:**

1. **Customize the codes** - Change each person's `code` value to something unique
2. **Set admin password** - Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` at the top
3. **Update year** - When 2026 comes, just change `YEAR` to 2026 for new assignments
4. **Host on GitHub Pages or Netlify** (as described earlier)
